Feature
Star Schema
Snowflake Schema
1. Structure
Central fact table is directly connected to dimension tables.
Dimension tables are normalized into related tables, forming a snowflake-like structure.
2. Complexity
Simpler to design and understand as it involves fewer joins and tables.
More complex due to a higher number of tables and joins.
3. Query Performance
Typically better performance due to fewer joins.
Slower performance because of multiple joins.
4. Scalability
Less scalable as complexity increases with more dimensions and measures.
More scalable and can handle large, complex datasets.
5. Manageability
Difficult to manage as the number of dimensions increases.
Easier to manage complex datasets with normalized structure.
6. Storage
Requires less storage due to fewer and simpler tables.
Requires more storage because of normalization and more tables.
