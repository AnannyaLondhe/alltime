Additionally, I have already applied for an exception to work from home on 21st April instead of 22nd April due to a brief online meeting scheduled by my college faculty regarding no-dues formalities. The meeting is expected to last only about 15 minutes post 4:00 PM, after which I will resume my regular work without any interruption.
